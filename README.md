# <b> Final Project: Warriors Unknown Maze </b>
Welcome to WUM by Dahong Jiang and Anne Zhang
## WHAT IS IT?
* Travel through a maze to get to a room. You will encounter enemies so don't be afraid to shoot! When you get to the room there will be enemies and a boss. You can always go back into the maze for boosts of health and more spears. GOAL: KILL THE BOSS. 
## HOW TO PLAY!
* Get familiar with the WASD keys (thats how you move!)
* To shoot click with your mouse whatever direction you want your spear to go! 
* There are ghosts with hp of 100. spooky! Each spear does 25 damage! 
* The boss has a hp of 500. BEWARE! It's secret power is that it can fly through walls. 
* Travel through the maze to get crates. (These crates contain 10 spears and boosts your health) WARNING! You might encounter a ghost along the way. 
* You might also need to travel through the maze to defeat the boss
* Don't make contact with the ghosts or boss you will get hurt
* DIFFICULTY LEVEL: MEDIUM?!
* DON'T DIE ;))
